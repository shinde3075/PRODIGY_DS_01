## Task-01: Population Distribution Analysis
## Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.
This project aims to analyze and visualize the distribution of population data for different countries over multiple years using bar charts and histograms. The dataset utilized contains information about the population of various countries over several years.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from `task01_Dataset.csv`. It contains demographic information, including population data, for different countries over multiple years.

### Methodology

1. **Data Loading and Preparation**:
   - Load the dataset using pandas and examine its structure to understand the available information.
   - Select a country of interest for population distribution analysis.

2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Filter population data for the chosen country from the dataset.
   - Extract years and population data for visualization.
   - Create two types of visualizations:
     - **Bar Chart**: Illustrates the population trend of the chosen country over the years.
     - **Histogram**: Represents the distribution of population data for the chosen country.

3. **Repeat Analysis for Different Countries**:
   - Repeat the analysis process for different countries to compare their population trends and distributions.

### Implementation

The analysis is performed for three different countries: Belgium, United States, and Austria. For each country, population data is filtered and visualized using both a bar chart and a histogram.

#### Belgium
- Filter population data for Belgium and visualize the population trend over the years using a bar chart.
- Represent the distribution of population data for Belgium using a histogram.

#### United States
- Filter population data for the United States and visualize the population trend over the years using a bar chart.
- Represent the distribution of population data for the United States using a histogram.

#### Austria
- Filter population data for Austria and visualize the population trend over the years using a bar chart.
- Represent the distribution of population data for Austria using a histogram.

### Visualizations

#### Bar Chart
- Displays the population trend of the chosen country over the years.
- X-axis: Year
- Y-axis: Population
- Title: Population Trend of [Chosen Country] Over the Years

#### Histogram
- Represents the distribution of population data for the chosen country.
- X-axis: Population
- Y-axis: Frequency
- Title: Distribution of Population in [Chosen Country]

### Conclusion

This project provides insights into the population distribution of various countries over time. By visualizing population trends and distributions, it aids in understanding demographic patterns and changes. Further analysis can be conducted to explore correlations with socio-economic factors and implications for policymaking.

### Usage

To perform population distribution analysis for different countries:
- Ensure accessibility to the dataset (`task01_Dataset.csv`).
- Execute the provided code for each country of interest.
- Analyze the bar chart and histogram to comprehend population trends and distributions for each country.

### Dependencies

- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library.
